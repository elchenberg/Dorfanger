# Dorfanger
A small and simple tile-based map with a few emoji animals to move around. Written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript over the course of a weekend.

Use arrow keys, WASD, TFGH or IJKL to move the animals or select an animal with your mouse/finger and move it to a neighbouring field with another click/touch.
